    I would like to install a GitHub repository. Please use the MCP Server tool to complete the following automated installation process:

    GitHub repository information [{repo_url}];   
    Installation location [{install_path}];

    Please execute the following steps, with each command separated by a semicolon instead of &&:

    1. Detect system information, including OS, Python version, and package manager availability.
    2. Clone a GitHub repository and return its path. Reuse the directory if already cloned.
    3. Analyze the cloned GitHub repository and collect installation-related information. Then generate a list of setup commands.
    4. Set up the environment for a previously cloned GitHub repository using provided commands.
    5. Analyze error text to identify possible causes.

    Please display the executed commands and results in detail for each step, and explain the key information in an easy-to-understand manner. 
    Separate all commands with semicolons instead of &&.

    some more to mention:
    1. do not spell words wrong, like NLP, mpc.
    2. do not use conda activate cut3r, use conda run -n cut3r instead.
    3. do not run all the command in one time, run one command at one time instead.
